# Assessment 02 - Networking

This contains a list of questions to assess a fellows knowledge of the **Networking** Learning Outcome

## Questions

1. Display network interfaces

	```
  	ifconfig -a
  	```

2. Display network routing table

  	```
  	netstat -rn
  	```

3. Disable **ICMP** ping requests to your local machine

	```
	iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j REJECT
	```

4. Use a subnet mask to allocate IP addresses on a network

  	Given the ip range **10.0.10.0/24**

  	```
  	minimum_ip_address="10.0.10.1"
  	maximum_ip_address="10.0.10.255"
  	```

  	Given the ip range **10.0.10.0/30**

  	```
  	minimum_ip_address="10.0.10.1"
  	maximum_ip_address="10.0.10.3"
  	```

5. Use `ssh` to forward port **2444** on remote machine **10.0.0.1** to local port **6333**

  	```
	ssh -L 6333:localhost:2444 10.0.0.1
  	```

6. Using `ssh` with authentication agent forwarded, connect to remote machine **10.0.0.1**

	```
	
	```

7. Using `ssh`, connect to remote machine **10.0.0.1** with the private key `private.key.pem`

	```
	ssh -i ~/.ssh/private.key.pem user@10.0.0.1
	```

8. Using `scp`, copy file `/home/user/file.txt` on remote machine **10.0.0.1** to your local machine

	```
	scp -i ~/.ssh/<private-key>.pem <user>@10.0.0.1:~/path/to/remote/file.txt /home/user/
	```

9. Using `scp`, copy local file at `/home/user/file.txt` to remote machine **10.0.0.1**

	```
	scp -i ~/.ssh/<private-key>.pem /home/user/file.txt <user>@10.0.0.1:~/path/to/remote/location/
	```

10. List all open ports on a system

	```
	netstat -lntu
	```

11. Block ip address from accessing all ports on your local machine using iptables

	```
	iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp -d <blocked-ip-address> -j DROP
	```

12. List differences between IPV4 & IPV6 addresses

	```
	1. An IPv6 address consists of 128 bits, while an IPv4 address consists of only 32.
	2. IPv6 has a lot more usable addresses compared to IPv4.
	3. IPv6 makes the routerâ€™s task more simple compared to IPv4.
	4. IPv6 is better suited to mobile networks than IPv4.
	5. IPv6 addresses are represented in a hexadecimal, colon-separated notation, while IPv4 address use the dot-decimal notation.
	6. IPv6 allows for bigger payloads than what is allowed in IPv4.
	7. IPv6 is used by less than 1% of the networks, while IPv4 is still in use by the remaining 99%.
	```
